```
{
  "repositories": [
    {
      "type": "git",
      "url": "https://github.com/brandon14/amazon-uploads-v20201101.git"
    }
  ],
  "require": {
    "brandon14/amazon-uploads-v20201101": "*@dev"
  }
}
```

Then run `composer install`

### Manual Installation

Download the files and include `autoload.php`:

```php
    require_once('/path/to//vendor/autoload.php');
```

## Tests

To run the unit tests:

```
composer install
./vendor/bin/phpunit
```

## Getting Started

Please follow the [installation procedure](#installation--usage) and then run the following:

```php
<?php
require_once(__DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php');

$apiInstance = new TNT\Amazon\Uploads\V20201101\Api\UploadsApi(
    // If you want use custom http client, pass your client which implements `GuzzleHttp\ClientInterface`.
    // This is optional, `GuzzleHttp\Client` will be used as default.
    new GuzzleHttp\Client()
);
$marketplace_ids = array("marketplace_ids_example"); // string[] | A list of marketplace identifiers. This specifies the marketplaces where the upload will be available. Only one marketplace can be specified.
$content_md5 = "content_md5_example"; // string | An MD5 hash of the content to be submitted to the upload destination. This value is used to determine if the data has been corrupted or tampered with during transit.
$resource = "resource_example"; // string | The resource for the upload destination that you are creating. For example, if you are creating an upload destination for the createLegalDisclosure operation of the Messaging API, the `{resource}` would be `/messaging/v1/orders/{amazonOrderId}/messages/legalDisclosure`, and the entire path would be `/uploads/2020-11-01/uploadDestinations/messaging/v1/orders/{amazonOrderId}/messages/legalDisclosure`. If you are creating an upload destination for an Aplus content document, the `{resource}` would be `aplus/2020-11-01/contentDocuments` and the path would be `/uploads/v1/uploadDestinations/aplus/2020-11-01/contentDocuments`.
$content_type = "content_type_example"; // string | The content type of the file to be uploaded.

try {
    $result = $apiInstance->createUploadDestinationForResource($marketplace_ids, $content_md5, $resource, $content_type);
    print_r($result);
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo 'Exception when calling UploadsApi->createUploadDestinationForResource: ', $e->getMessage(), PHP_EOL;
}

?>
```
